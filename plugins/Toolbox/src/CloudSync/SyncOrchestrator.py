## Orchestrates the synchronizing of packages from the user account to the installed packages
# Example flow:
# - CloudPackageChecker compares a list of packages the user `subscribed` to in their account
#   If there are `discrepancies` between the account and locally installed packages, they are emitted
# - DiscrepanciesPresenter shows a list of packages to be added or removed to the user. It emits the `packageMutations`
#   the user selected to be performed
# - The SyncOrchestrator uses PackageManager to remove local packages the users wants to see removed
# - The DownloadPresenter shows a download progress dialog
# - The LicencePresenter extracts licences from the downloaded packages and presents a licence for each package to
# - be installed. It emits the `licenceAnswers` {'packageId' : bool} for accept or declines
# - The CloudPackageManager removes the declined packages from the account
# - The SyncOrchestrator uses PackageManager to install the downloaded packages.
# - Bliss / profit / done
